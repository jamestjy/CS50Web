# Search

Project 0 of CS50 Web

This project involves simulating the front page aesthetics of Google's 3 search methods, regular, image and advanced, with the same functionality of searching.

Though a rather simple task, I am able to refine my HTML/CSS skills, and learnt how form query strings work. I used the network tab under
developer tools, to view which names/values Google uses for their forms, such as as_q and as_epq, and implement them respectively in my own project.

Besides this, this is the first time I am using my own codespace, as opposed to the cloud-based one provided by CS50. I have had to learn how to take advantage of VSCode's interface, and more importantly how to use Git, and github.
