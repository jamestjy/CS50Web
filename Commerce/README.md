# Commerce

Project 2 of CS50 Web

This project involved using Django in conjuction with SQL databases to create an e-commerce auction site that will allow users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a watchlist.

From this project, I have learnt about many new features. These are some of the most prominent:

I learnt that models and migrations are an easy way to represent SQL databases in python. I have implemented 4 models into my project, a User, Listing, Bid, and Comment model, and taken advantage of the different functions that come per model.

I also learnt SQL basics, most importantly, how to query, and using primary/foreign keys to set different kinds of relationships between tables.

I have also learnt how to implement user authentication in Django, including creating user accounts, handling logins, and managing user sessions, as well as that of a Superuser, going to their admin site to directly manipulate its SQL databases much more easily.

Other miscellaneous learning points would include using bootstrap, message tags, args/kwargs, and more.
