# Mail

Project 3 of CS50 Web

This project had me started on Javascript, in conjunction with Django's database, to create a single-page application to simulate an email app.

The app boasts functionality for loading different types of inboxes and individual emails, sending and receiving emails, archiving, and the ability to reply to the emails with a pre-formatted subject and body.

This project has also taught me how to use API's, and how JSON works to communicate information between 2 different pieces of software.
