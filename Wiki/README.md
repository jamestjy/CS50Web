# Wiki

Project 1 of CS50 Web

This projects involves using Django to simulate a wikipedia page, with functions to create/edit pages, search for pages, choose a random page, and list 404 errors when appropriate

I learnt the basics of Django, such as the how general structure of a django site operates, how to manipulate urls, views, and how to render or redirect to the corresponding templates, by passing in context.

I also learnt how to use forms in Django, understanding the action and method attributes, the 2 most common ones being GET and POST, how to display different results/pages depending on what the user inputs, etc

There are a few miscellanous things I've learnt as well, including what CSRF tokens are, how HTTP works, and how loopback IP 127.0.0.1 and ports work, like 8000 for Django.

Lastly, I was also exposed to new python packages like markdown2.
